      quote: "Vimal Sir is outstanding while teaching complex and advanced topics, as he teaches us in such a way that even someone without technical background one can easily grasp and this is the main reason I have been following him since long. Before his session, I had tried to understand DevSecOps through various technical channels, but I didn't get a clear picture. However, in just initial hours of Vimal Sir‚Äôs session, he made the concept very much clearer. Then, over the next two hours, he simplified DevSecOps further, helping me gain valuable insights that sparked my interest in exploring the topic more deeply. I am Thankful to Vimal Sir for in-depth course on DevSecOps and looking more indepth session from him, and Im grateful for his teachings for current and upcoming valuable training sessions.",

It was such a wonderful experience to part of. Also, Mr. Vimal Daga Sir was a great personality, and I really felt honor to get a chance to learn from a teacher like him. He is not just a world record holder for learning the technologies but also applying them to solve real life problems. He taught us what it means to be a true engineer. The emotional support he provides is something which is nowhere to be found.",
